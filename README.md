This lightweight application acts as a HTTP logging proxy for developing and staging environments. If you put it between an HTTP client and the respective server you can easily monitor requests and responses.

## Installation

### Docker (recommended)

Pull the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdschulze/restinthemiddle/tags) from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull jdschulze/restinthemiddle:2
```

Pinning the version to (at least) the major version is highly recommended. Use `latest` at your own risk. ATM the `latest` tag is always the `HEAD` of the `main` branch but this can change without notice anytime.

### Build the Docker image yourself

Clone this repository and run `make docker`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/restinthemiddle/restinthemiddle.git
cd restinthemiddle
git checkout main
make docker
```

### Build the binary yourself

Clone this repository and run `make build`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/restinthemiddle/restinthemiddle.git
cd restinthemiddle
git checkout main
make build
```

## Usage

Typically, you place the logging proxy between an application and an API. This is the use case Restinthemiddle was developed for.

```text
+-----------------+         +-----------------+         +-----------------+
|                 +-------->+                 +-------->+                 |
|   Application   |         | Restinthemiddle |         |       API       |
|                 +<--------+                 +<--------+                 |
+-----------------+         +-----------------+         +-----------------+
```

But there are cases where it makes sense to place it between your browser and the application. For example, you could want to add custom headers to every request (kind of off-label use, because no logging is needed):

```text
+-----------------+         +-----------------+         +-----------------+
|                 +-------->+                 +-------->+                 |
|     Browser     |         | Restinthemiddle |         |   Application   |
|                 +<--------+                 +<--------+                 |
+-----------------+         +-----------------+         +-----------------+
```

You may as well use Restinthemiddle as an alternative entrypoint for your application.

### Configuration

Configuration is handled by [spf13/viper](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/viper).

Restinthemiddle is intended for use in a containerized environment. Therefore it is configurable entirely via environment variables - almost!
Headers have to be set via command line arguments or the configuration file.

The ascending order of precedence (last wins) is:

* Restinthemiddle default values
* Configuration via YAML file
* Configuration via Environment variables
* Command line arguments

Example configuration file:

```yaml
targetHostDsn: www.example.com
listenIp: 0.0.0.0
listenPort: "8000"
headers:
    X-My-Header: myexamplevalue
loggingEnabled: true
setRequestId: false
exclude: ""
logPostBody: true
logResponseBody: true
excludePostBody: ""
excludeResponseBody: ""
readTimeout: 30
readHeaderTimeout: 10
writeTimeout: 30
idleTimeout: 120
```

There are several file locations where configuration is being searched for. The ascending order of precedence (last wins) is:

* `/etc/restinthemiddle/config.yaml`
* `$HOME/.restinthemiddle/config.yaml`
* `./config.yaml`

**Note:** See the [net/http.Server documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server) for detailed information about the behavior of `ReadTimeout`, `ReadHeaderTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, and `IdleTimeout`.

##### Timeout Configuration

**Important:** The default timeout values are `0` (no timeout), which matches the behavior of Go's `net/http.Server`. While this provides maximum flexibility, it can expose your service to resource exhaustion and security vulnerabilities.

**Recommended production values:**

```yaml
readTimeout: 30
readHeaderTimeout: 10
writeTimeout: 30
idleTimeout: 120
```

**Why you should configure timeouts:**

* **ReadHeaderTimeout (recommended: 10s)**: Protects against [Slowloris attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)) where clients send headers very slowly to exhaust server resources.
* **ReadTimeout (recommended: 30s)**: Prevents slow clients from holding connections indefinitely while sending request bodies.
* **WriteTimeout (recommended: 30s)**: Ensures responses are sent in a reasonable timeframe, preventing resource leaks from slow or stalled connections.
* **IdleTimeout (recommended: 120s)**: Controls how long keep-alive connections remain open between requests, balancing connection reuse with resource management.

**Without explicit timeouts:**

* Vulnerable to slowloris and similar DoS attacks
* Risk of resource exhaustion from hanging connections
* Potential memory leaks from abandoned connections
* No protection against malicious or buggy clients

**With proper timeouts:**

* Protection against common attack vectors
* Predictable resource usage
* Automatic cleanup of stale connections
* Better overall system stability

##### The target host DSN

`schema://username:password@hostname:port/basepath?query`

* `schema` (required) is `http` or `https`
* `username:password@` is optional and will be evaluated only if both values are set.
* `hostname` (required)
* `port` is optional. Standard ports are `80` (http) and `443` (https).
* `basepath` is optional. Will be prefixed to any request URL path pointed at Restinthemiddle. See examples section.
* `query` is optional. If set, `query` will precede the actual request's query.

##### Headers

If a header is defined multiple times, the last assignment wins.

If you need to make a HTTP Basic Authentication **and** need to send another Authorization header at the same time (e.g. a JWT) we have got you covered. Just put the HTTP Basic Auth credentials into the _target host DSN_ string:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -e TARGET_HOST_DSN=http://user:password@www.example.com -p 8000:8000 jdschulze/restinthemiddle:2 --header="Authorization:Bearer ABCD1234"
```

## Examples

### Basic

We want to log HTTP calls against `www.example.com` over an insecure connection.

```bash
# Set up the proxy
docker run -it --rm -e TARGET_HOST_DSN=http://www.example.com -p 8000:8000 jdschulze/restinthemiddle:2

# In another terminal window we make the API call against http://www.example.com/api/visitors
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/visitors
```

### Advanced

We want to log HTTP calls against `www.example.com:4430` over a TLS connection (`https://…`). The API is protected by HTTP basic auth (username: `user`; password: `pass`). The base path always starts with `api/`.

Note that the base path defined in `TARGET_HOST_DSN` prefixes any subsequent calls!

```bash
# Set up the proxy
docker run -it --rm -e TARGET_HOST_DSN=https://user:pass@www.example.com:4430/api?start=1577833200 -p 8000:8000 jdschulze/restinthemiddle:2

# In another terminal window we make the API call against https://user:pass@www.example.com:4430/api/visitors?start=1577833200
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/visitors
```

### Setting/changing headers

We want to log HTTP calls against `www.example.com` over an insecure connection. Every request has to be enhanced with a custom header `X-App-Version: 3.0.0`. No logging shall take place.

#### With configuration file

##### config.yaml

```yaml
targetHostDsn: http://www.example.com
headers:
    X-App-Version: '3.0.0'
loggingEnabled: false
```

```bash
# Set up the proxy
docker run -it --rm -v ./config.yaml:/restinthemiddle/config.yaml -p 8000:8000 jdschulze/restinthemiddle:2

# In another terminal window we make the API call against http://www.example.com/home
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
```

#### With command line arguments

```bash
# Set up the proxy
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 jdschulze/restinthemiddle:2 restinthemiddle --target-host-dsn=http://www.example.com --header=x-app-version:3.0.0
```

### Helm Chart for Kubernetes

There is a Helm Chart for Restinthemiddle at [https://github.com/restinthemiddle/helm](https://github.com/restinthemiddle/helm).
You may want to add the Restinthemiddle Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add restinthemiddle https://restinthemiddle.github.io/helm
helm repo update
```
